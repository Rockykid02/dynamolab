  <p>Ethical hacking is the process of using hacking skills for positive purposes, such as testing the security of computer systems and networks, or finding and fixing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious hackers. Ethical hackers, also known as "white hat hackers," work with organizations to help them improve their security. They use their skills to find and fix security holes, without causing any harm or damage. Ethical hacking is an important part of keeping computer systems and networks safe from Attacks</p>

     <h2>Password Hacking</h2>
     <p>Password hacking, also known as password cracking, is the process of guessing or cracking a password in order to gain unauthorized access to a system or account.

They may be hired by companies to test their systems for vulnerabilities, or they may hack systems as a way to expose security flaws so that they can be fixed. White hat hackers operate within the law, and with the permission of the system owners. They often use the same techniques as black hat hackers, but with the goal of improving security rather than causing harm</p>
      <h3>Grey Hat Hackers</h3> 
      <p>These are Hybrib between Black and White Hackers ..Grey hat hackers, sometimes called "hacktivists,"  They may hack systems without permission, but they typically don't have malicious intent. Instead, they may hack a system to expose a vulnerability, or to make a political statement. They may also hack for fun or for personal gain, but without causing any damage
